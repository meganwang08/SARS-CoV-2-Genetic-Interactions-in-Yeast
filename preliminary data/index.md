# Preliminary Findings
Nsp1-10, 14, and the structural proteins have all been screened through SPA. From the results of the initial screens, I have decided to focus on nsp14. Nsp14 has two catalytic sites: a proofreading exonuclease (ExoN) domain and a guanine-N7-methyltransferase (MT) domain{% include superscript.html text='[10](https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01246-20),'%} {% include superscript.html text='[11](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1508686112)'%}. The 3’ to 5’ ExoN domain proofreads and processes the nascent RNA strand from the SARS-CoV-2 replisome, which leads to resistance to certain drugs made of replication terminating nucleic acid analogs as it can excise incorrect nucleotides. The methyltransferase domain is responsible for N7 methylation in the final step of 5’ RNA capping. Formation of the cap1 structure at the 5′ end of viral mRNA assists in translation and evading host defense11.
